/// Lifecycle:
/// - App launch / foreground / BGProcessingTask wake → `start(...)` kicks off
///   a worker if there's anything pending.
/// - Worker drains the queue one song at a time. Each cloud-source connector

///   actually parallelize; one worker per source plus shared throttle is the
///   sweet spot.
/// - Failed songs (corrupt / missing / decoder rejected) are recorded so we
///   don't retry them every launch. Successful ones are replaced in the
///   library and persist via `MusicLibrary.persistSnapshot()`.
